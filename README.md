# 3DTransformations
This C++ project utilizes basic transformations like rotation and translation to project 3D figures onto a 2D plane. It features a user-friendly GUI and extends the functionality to offer immersive visualization of three-dimensional objects.

The main features of the project include:
- 3D projection and animation of a figure.
- The figure can be rotated around the X, Y, and Z axes.
- The rotation angles (alpha, phi) and translation values (tX, tY, tZ) can be modified.
- Four timers for different animations and an additional timer for rainbow effect.
- Allows for user interaction with the figure, such as rotating and translating it.
